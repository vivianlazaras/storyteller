# Introduction
StoryTeller is intended to be an application protocol, with different implementations aimed at creating an ecosystem for story creation, sharing, and world building. I've always known I wanted to be creative, and have always wanted to find a way to build the worlds that I imagine in my head, but often the things that I imagine are often highly disjointed, and disconnected. Knowing that I have tons of "pieces" to a story but lack a common thread to tie them all together save my life story, I wanted to create a visual way to represent components, and assets within a story, thus the storyteller project was born.

## Goals
This project aims to make telling stories easier, especially when its extremely difficult to share the story. By building a tool in which a user can piece together small individual components with rich description, and styling this code provides a means to slowly articulate a story over time as it becomes easier to tell.

Primary Goals:
1. Graphical representations of component relationships.
2. End to End encryption for secure usage.
3. Self Hostability (make it easy for anyone to run the server, and client code).
4. Easy extensibility.
5. Federated authentication and content distribution.

### Why Self Hostable Matters.

## Context

### The Struggle to write.
I have always struggled with the ability to communicate with other people, I am coming to see the beauty in the world around me, but have always found beauty in imagination, in thinking about what could be. Unfortunately though I have come across far too many horror stories, including in my own life, that were difficult to talk about, feeling like I was faced with insurmountable obsticles to share my own story, and express my creative desire for who I could be, what the world could be I often found myself getting lost in fantasies other people had created, whether that was anime, audiobooks, or fictional TV dramas. 

Given how difficult it can be to share even wonderful beautiful and creative fictional stories, let alone the dark truths we wish didn't exist, I wanted to create a means for people to contribute to our cultural stories little by little, in whatever way they could, while also slowly finding ways to share their own stories.

I don't expect the comming decades to be easy, indeed I understand all too well the desire to project insecurities onto others, and the fear of the future, but in being able to write my own story, in being able to feel heard I hope to reclaim our cultural stories, and sense of community for the challenges we will have to face as climate change, and growing inequity become more and more challenging throughout the world. 

### Current Digital Media Landscape.
It's been a frustration of mine how difficult it can be to relisten to or rewatch old favorites, if I purchased something I should be able to play it, but either the platform has been lost, or I never really purchased the rights to view the content, you can imagine my frustration and modern content distribution systems, especially streaming services.

As a technical user, and someone often tasked with helping out other people, it's also been an immense frustration to content with the inability to share content, DRM protected content making it difficult to stream a netflix series online, or record video game consoles for replays effectively, or hell even having a computer say it's monitor doesn't exist because it's implementation of content protection algorithims is so stringent it doesn't recognize older models of monitors. 

I've never believed that artists shouldn't be paid for their work, rather quite the opposite, they should be more equitably compensated for their work, rather than having the dichotomy of "struggling artist" "artist who makes it big, then gets greedy" I wanted to present a way of imagining content distribution that helps struggling creatives get their content shown within the digital ecosystem we've cultivated, while avoiding already established creative's from beating out aspiring new artists, all while a production company takes all the profit for themselves, and so I build storyteller, a tool, and an ecosystem for reimaging art's compensation for their work.
