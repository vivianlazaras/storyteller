## Relationships

Relationships model the connections between narrative entities in this system. Below is a diagram representing the current relationship hierarchy:

```

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Subfragment         (fragment â†’ fragment)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Character           (mentions)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Location            (occurs_at)
â”œâ”€â”€ Character
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Location            (resides_in / visits)

### Notes on Hierarchy

- A **story** is the root entity (unless working with a larger narrative universe).
- A **story** can contain:
  - Fragments (scenes),
  - Characters,
  - Locations,
  - Substories.
- A **fragment** can include:
  - Subfragments (nested scenes),
  - Characters involved,
  - A location where the scene takes place.
- A **character** can:
  - Appear in fragments,
  - Be associated with specific locations.
- A **location** can:
  - Contain fragments occurring at that place.

While stories form the root of the hierarchy, other entities (fragments, characters, locations) may form recursive or cyclical structures where appropriate.
